App Description:

This app is to train non-musicians and non-dancers how to find the beat. It uses Spotify's
Software Development Kit (SDK) in the background as a player. While the song plays, the user gets a
partial cue for when to tap to the beat and then the user's performance is scored against the audio
analysis beats information provided by Spotify's Web API.


How to Run:

Download Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio

Clone the repository

Register the app with Spotify to get a Client ID: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/

Create a file named "apikey.properties" Add to it your Client ID as follows, filling in your ID

where indicated:
    CLIENT_ID = "<Your client ID here>"

You will need Spotify App to run on your emulator or physical device, including login information
